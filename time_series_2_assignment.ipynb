        "1. Visualization\n",
        "Plot the time series: One of the simplest ways to identify seasonality is to plot the data. If there's a repeating pattern over fixed periods (like every year, month, or week), this often indicates seasonality.\n",
        "Seasonal subseries plot: This involves plotting the data by season (e.g., months or quarters). If there's a clear repetitive pattern for each season, it suggests a seasonal component.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Autocorrelation Function (ACF)\n",
        "ACF plot: The ACF can be used to determine if there is a seasonal cycle by examining the correlation between observations at different lags. For instance, if a time series has yearly seasonality, there will be high correlation at lags of 12 months (for monthly data).\n",
        "Peaks at regular intervals in the ACF plot suggest a seasonal pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Fourier Transform\n",
        "Spectral analysis (Fourier analysis): This method decomposes the time series into sine and cosine waves of different frequencies. If a strong frequency component exists at a particular period, it indicates seasonality.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Seasonal Decomposition\n",
        "Classical decomposition: This method decomposes the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. It can be done using the moving average or regression models to separate the seasonal component from the rest of the data.\n",
        "STL decomposition: The Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method is another powerful tool that can be used to identify time-dependent seasonal components, especially when the seasonality is not constant over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Decompose Using Statistical Models\n",
        "SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): If the time series exhibits seasonality, SARIMA models include seasonal components explicitly. The model can help identify the period and strength of seasonality by specifying seasonal autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) terms.\n",
        "Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (ETS): ETS models allow for the modeling of trend, seasonality, and error terms. The seasonal component is particularly useful for time-dependent seasonality.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Periodogram Analysis\n",
        "Periodogram: This is a method of identifying periodic components in time series data by estimating the strength of various frequencies. Peaks in the periodogram correspond to potential seasonal components in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Correlation with Exogenous Variables\n",
        "External factors: If seasonality is linked to external factors (like weather, holidays, or business cycles), analyzing correlations with those exogenous variables can help identify seasonal patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Change Point Detection\n",
        "If seasonal patterns are changing over time, change point detection methods can identify shifts in the seasonality. These methods are particularly useful in the presence of non-stationary seasonality.\n",
